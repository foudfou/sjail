# sjail

Simple thin jail management tool.

Provides:

1. a straightforward script to create/destroy jails
2. recipes in the form of shell scripts

## Motivation

- Easy to understand.
- Limited rigid feature set:
  - Leverage jail(8) as much as possible;
  - Thin jails only;
  - Networking via cloned loopback interface or shared interface;

## Usage

```
# make install
```

For loopback networking (optional):

```
# sysrc cloned_interfaces+="lo1"
# service netif cloneup
```

Create and review `/usr/local/etc/sjail.conf`:

## Recipes

Recipes live by convention in `${zfs_mount}/recipes`.

Recipes are directly inspired by Bastille templates[^1]. A recipe is a
directory comprised of:

1. A mandatory `apply.sh` file which contains *commands*.
2. Optional files to be deployed via the `CP` command.

`apply.sh` is a shell script[^2]. Commands are shell functions.

|           |                                                      |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `CMD`     |                                                      |
| `CONF`    | **breaking compat**: name change + no `set` argument |
| `CP`      | copies recursively                                   |
| `INCLUDE` |                                                      |
| `MOUNT`   |                                                      |
| `PKG`     |                                                      |
| `EXPOSE`  | **breaking compat**: name change                     |
| `SERVICE` |                                                      |
| `SYSRC`   |                                                      |

Note the compatibility changes (**breaking compat**) when migrating from Bastille.

## Networking

Sjail only supports these networking setups: shared interface or cloned
loopback interface.

### Shared interface

Jails' IPs are attached to the host's external interface and thus accessible to
the local network. No specific `pf` adaptation is required.

### Cloned loopback

Jails' IPs are attached to a clone loopback interface. Traffic between host and
jails is enabled with `pf`: outgoing via NAT, incoming via RDR.

```
ext_if=vtnet0
icmp_types  = "{ echoreq, unreach }"
icmp6_types = "{ echoreq, unreach, routeradv, neighbrsol, neighbradv }"

# sjail-managed
table <jails> persist

set skip on lo

# sjail-managed
rdr-anchor "rdr/*"

nat on $ext_if from <jails> to any -> ($ext_if:0)

block in all
pass out all keep state
antispoof for $ext_if

pass inet proto icmp icmp-type $icmp_types
pass inet6 proto icmp6 icmp6-type $icmp6_types

# Allow ssh
pass in inet proto tcp from any to any port ssh flags S/SA keep state
```

Port forwarding is persisted to `${jail_path}/rdr.conf` as lines of the format
`<proto> <host_port> <client_port>` lines. They are applied *for ip4 and ip6*
via `pf` rdr rules on jail start and cleared on jail stop.

`rdr.conf` can be created manually of via the recipe `EXPOSE` command.

## Upgrade

Provided the jails don't hold important state, upgrading to a new minor or
major release is best done by re-creating them.

For minor release changes, pointing the jails' `fstab`s to the new release
after stopping them is also a viable option.

## How it works

See [internals](./doc/internals.md).

## Contributing

All feedback and PRs welcome. When hacking on the code, make sure to run tests
in an isolated environment.
