# sjail

Simple thin jail management tool.

Provides:

1. a straightforward script to create/destroy jails
2. recipe scripts to customize jails, heavily inspired by [Bastille](https://github.com/BastilleBSD/bastille)

## Motivation

- Easy to understand.
- Limited rigid feature set:
  - Leverage jail(8) as much as possible;
  - ZFS thin jails only;
  - Networking via shared interface or cloned loopback interface and `pf`;

## Usage

```
# make install
```

For loopback networking (optional):

```
# sysrc cloned_interfaces+="lo1"
# service netif cloneup
```

Create and review `/usr/local/etc/sjail.conf`:

## Recipes

Recipes live by convention in `${zfs_mount}/recipes`.

Recipes are directly inspired by Bastille templates[^1]. A recipe is a
directory comprised of:

1. A mandatory `apply.sh` file which contains *commands*.
2. Optional files to be deployed via the `CP` command.

`apply.sh` is a shell script[^2]. Commands are shell functions.

| Command   | Comments                                                                                        |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CMD`     | arguments executed inside `sh -c`. I.e. quote commands with redirects, logical operations, etc. |
| `CONF`    | **breaking compat**: name change + no `set` argument.                                           |
| `CP`      | copies recursively                                                                              |
| `INCLUDE` |                                                                                                 |
| `MOUNT`   |                                                                                                 |
| `PKG`     |                                                                                                 |
| `EXPOSE`  | **breaking compat**: name change                                                                |
| `RESTART` | convenient in conjunction with `CONF`                                                           |
| `SERVICE` |                                                                                                 |
| `SYSRC`   |                                                                                                 |

### Compatibility with Bastille

When migrating from Bastille templates, here's a little checklist:

- Command names; see **breaking compat** in the previous table
- `ARG` is replaced with the `sh` equivalent:
  ```diff
  -ARG php_prefix=php82
  +php_prefix=${php_prefix:-php82}
  ```
- `INCLUDE` arguments are also replaced with the `sh` equivalent:
  ```diff
  -INCLUDE my/service-php --arg php_prefix=php82
  +INCLUDE my/service-php php_prefix=php82
  ```
  - Make sure to escape spaces in strings:
    ```
    INCLUDE foudfou/service-nodejs npm_global="pm2\ pnpm" # otherwise interpreted as npm_global=pm2
    ```

Optional arguments must still be defined:

```sh
maxmemory=${maxmemory:-}
maxmemory_policy=${maxmemory_policy:-}
```

## Networking

Sjail only supports these networking setups: shared interface or cloned
loopback interface.

The network setup is determined by the `interface` parameter in `sjail.conf`.

### Shared interface

When the `interface` parameter doesn't start with `lo`, it's interpreted as
external interface.

Jails get IPs attached to the host's external interface and are in the same
subnet:

```
# Provided host ip = 192.168.1.23/24 and interface="em0" in sjail.conf
sjail create j01 14.2-RELEASE ip4=192.168.1.201/24
```

Jails are thus accessible to the local network. No specific `pf` adaptation is
required.

### Cloned loopback

When the `interface` parameter starts with `lo`, it's interpreted as a cloned
loopback interface.

Jails' IPs are attached to a clone loopback interface. Traffic between host and
jails is enabled with `pf`: outgoing via NAT, incoming via RDR.

```
ext_if=vtnet0
icmp_types  = "{ echoreq, unreach }"
icmp6_types = "{ echoreq, unreach, routeradv, neighbrsol, neighbradv }"

# sjail-managed
table <jails> persist

set skip on lo

# sjail-managed
rdr-anchor "rdr/*"

nat on $ext_if from <jails> to any -> ($ext_if:0)

block in all
pass out all keep state
antispoof for $ext_if

pass inet proto icmp icmp-type $icmp_types
pass inet6 proto icmp6 icmp6-type $icmp6_types

# Allow ssh
pass in inet proto tcp from any to any port ssh flags S/SA keep state
```

Port forwarding is persisted to `${jail_path}/rdr.conf` as lines of the format
`<proto> <host_port> <client_port>` lines. They are applied *for ip4 and ip6*
via `pf` rdr rules on jail start and cleared on jail stop.

`rdr.conf` can be created manually of via the recipe `EXPOSE` command.

### Custom

Networking can be fine-tuned and NAT or RDR can be enabled individually,
respectively with the `nat=[0|1|]` and `rdr=[0|1|]` parameters.

These parameters are persisted to `${jail_path}/meta.conf`.

For example, we can enable NAT for outgoing traffic but disable RDR for
incoming traffic:

`sjail create j01 14.2-RELEASE ip4=192.168.1.201/24 nat=1 rdr=0`

One use case for this is a host with a VPN that forwards default traffic to the
VPN server, and jails that:

- are exposed to local network
- can reach out to the internet (ex: pkg install)
- but don't expose ports to the VPN network (`pf_ext_if=vpn_cli_if`)

A solution to these requirements is a *shared interface* setup and only
enabling NAT for jails.

## Upgrade

Provided the jails don't hold important state, upgrading to a new minor or
major release is best done by re-creating them.

For minor release changes, pointing the jails' `fstab`s to the new release
after stopping them is also a viable option.

## How it works

Feedback and PRs welcome. When hacking on the code, make sure to run tests in
isolated environments (See [t/README.md](./t/README.md) and
